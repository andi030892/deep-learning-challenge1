## 1. Overview:

* The **purpose** of the [analysis](https://bootcampspot.instructure.com/courses/3337/assignments/54017?module_item_id=962033) is to create a tool for the nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures.
* The **data** source is an [.csv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) file compiled by Alphabet Soup’s business team containing information on more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years.
* The **processes** are [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) and [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network), which are employed to construct a [binary classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_classification) that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
* The **tools** of the project are [TensorFlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TensorFlow), a free [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) [library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)) with a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks, and [Keras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keras), another open-source library that provides a [Python](https://www.python.org/) interface for TensorFlow. Coding was conducted in Python.
* **Success** is defined as creating a tool with a predictive power of 75% or more: i.e., its predictions are correct 75% of the time or more.
